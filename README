# conduit-threadpool

(a-async proc) wraps a proc in a version that runs asynchronously an yields a
clojure future of the result.

(a-threadpool tp proc) wraps a proc in a proc that will run the original proc
on the specified threadpool. this is useful for limiting certain pipeline stages
to only run on a give number of threads by means of a fixed-thread-pool

## Limitations

doesn't play well with a-loop

doesn't play well with pipeline stages that don't return a value
